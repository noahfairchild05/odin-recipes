    <p>If you like grilled cheese, but dont like the burnt 
        edges, this recipe is for you!</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>8 slices of white bread</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of softened butter</li>
       </ul> 
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Spread a thin layer on each side of the bread</li>
        <li>Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller 
            than the sandwich sealer, press out round slices of cheese. 
            Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface, buttered side down. 
            Place a cheese round in the center of each slice. 
            Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up</li>
        <li>Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down, 
            and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. 
            Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard. 
            Repeat with remaining sandwiches</li>
        <li>Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze 
            for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer bag</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F. Cook frozen sandwiches until golden, 
            about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, cook 3 minutes at 
            370 degrees F</li>
       </ol>
